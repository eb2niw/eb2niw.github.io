    <h1>EB-2 NIW Success Story</h1>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-xl-7 col-lg-8 col-md-10 col-sm-12 col-12">
        <p>Our journey as a European family relocating to the US with an existing employer was driven by one overarching goal: obtaining a green card, the key to realizing the American dream.</p>
        <p>For us, the green card represented more than just legal residency; it symbolized <span style="font-weight: 600">freedom</span> — the freedom to <span style="font-weight: 600">live and work in the US independently</span>, <span style="font-weight: 600">without the constraints of visa</span> renewals, <span style="font-weight: 600">employer sponsorship</span>, and the <span style="font-weight: 600">risk of layoff</span>.</p>
        <p>Our journey to realizing this dream was anything but straightforward. Rejected by over <span style="font-weight: 600">30 lawyers who deemed our case unconventional</span> — as we were professionals, while lawyers typically prioritize researchers with publications and citations — we persisted. Ultimately, with the right legal support, we prepared our documents to pursue the EB-2 NIW Advanced Degree category. After filing our application, we eagerly awaited the outcome.</p>
        <p>Within three months, our <span style="font-weight: 600">Employment Authorization Document (EAD)</span> arrived, granting us the flexibility to change employers while our green card application was in process.</p>
        <p>After nine months of anticipation, our perseverance paid off when we finally <span style="font-weight: 600">received our green card</span>.</p>
        <p>Our journey inspired us to create <a href="https://www.selfpetitionusa.com" class="link">Self Petition USA</a>, a platform offering <span style="font-weight: 600">EB-2 NIW Advanced Degree templates</span> for various professions, including our successful non-RFE petition. We started with <a href="https://www.selfpetitionusa.com/#starterKitProfessions" class="link">Starter Kit</a> templates that users can personalize, and later introduced <a href="https://www.selfpetitionusa.com/ai" class="link">Selfpetition AI</a>. This artificial intelligence tool is designed to generate well-organized I-140 cover letters, complete with a proposed appendix list, and corresponding reference letters that are tailored to your unique background, thus eliminating the need for manual drafting.</p>
